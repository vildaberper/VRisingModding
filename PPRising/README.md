# PP Rising

**Client and server mod.**

PP Rising is very much in development, but the end goal is to have a collection of QoL-features that makes sense to me.

## Quick Stack

Compulsively count to nearby containers.

### Config

- `Enable` [default `true`]: Enable quick stacking.
- `Distance` [default `20`]: Maximum distance to container.
- `NameIgnore` [default `nostack`]: Ignore containers with name including this.
- `SortOnStack` [default `true`]: Sort the container after stacking to it.
- Control `Quick Stack` [default `Insert`]: Hotkey for quick stacking.
